	    Decaffeination is the removal of caffeine from coffee beans, cocoa, tea leaves and other caffeine-containing materials. (While soft drinks which do not use caffeine as an ingredient are sometimes described as "decaffeinated", they are better termed "uncaffeinated" because decaffeinated implies that there was caffeine present at one point in time. Decaffeinated drinks contain typically 1â€“2% of the original caffeine content, and sometimes as much as 20%
