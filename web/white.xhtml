            White tea is a lightly oxidized tea grown and harvested primarily in China, mostly in the Fujian and province.[1] More recently it is grown in Galle (Southern Sri lanka), Taiwan, India, Northern Thailand and Eastern Nepal.

White tea comes from the buds and leaves of the Chinese Camellia sinensis plant. The leaves and buds are allowed to wither in natural sunlight before they are lightly processed to prevent oxidation or further tea processing.

The name "white tea" derives from the fine silvery-white hairs on the unopened buds of the tea plant, which gives the plant a whitish appearance.[2] The beverage itself is not white or colourless but pale yellow.
